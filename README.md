# Dataset Information (Additional Information)

The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.

122 instances for each region. 

The period from June 2012 to September 2012. 
The dataset includes 11 attribues and 1 output attribue (class)
The 244 instances have been classified into â€˜fireâ€™ (138 classes) and â€˜not fireâ€™ (106 classes) classes.

Has Missing Values?

No
